This is a example post to show how to create github hosted web page. Firstly, i create a repo is named "hkulekci.github.com":http://github.com/hkulekci/hkulekci.github.com . After that i went to my kulekci.net hosting and changed the following dns records. "Settings":https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages

That's All.
