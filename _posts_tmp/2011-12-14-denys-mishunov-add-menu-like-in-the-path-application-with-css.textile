<p>Yesterday I have installed the <a href="https://path.com/" title="The Path application">Path app</a> on my iPhone. I was really pleased with how slick the application is. Not functionally, because it doesn’t do anything special — yet another way of “socializing”, but how the app has been built and even tiny details are thought through. Really good&#8230;</p>
