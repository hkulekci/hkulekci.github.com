You can use following instruction on .htaccess file if you want to protect some files from users.

    1. List your protect file ( for example : i try to protect my *.tpl, *.log, *.ini, *.txt files)
    2. are there any ignore file? (I have a robots.txt file. it was ignored from protection)
    3. Create your htaccess
    <code>
        # Prevent Direct Access to files
        <FilesMatch “(?i)((.tpl|.ini|.log|(?<!robots).txt))”>
         Order deny,allow
         Deny from all
        </FilesMatch>
    </code>
    4. “Options -Indexes” use to disable directory browsing
    5. “IndexIgnore *” use to prevent folder listing

In these case, “(?i)” part of the example is for caseless matching. And <code>(?<robots).txt</code> part is for ignori robots.txt file and protecting all the others.

If you want to ignore more file like robots.txt file. You can add like this <code>(?<robots|test|ignored|file).txt</code>. Now, users can access robots.txt, test.txt, ignored.txt, file.txt
