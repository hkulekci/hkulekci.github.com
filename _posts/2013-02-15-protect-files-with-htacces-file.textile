You can use following instruction on .htaccess file if you want to protect some files from users.

    List your protect file ( for example : i try to protect my *.tpl, *.log, *.ini, *.txt files)
    are there any ignore file? (I have a robots.txt file. it was ignored from protection)
    Create your htaccess

    # Prevent Direct Access to files
    <FilesMatch “(?i)((.tpl|.ini|.log|(?<!robots).txt))”>
     Order deny,allow
     Deny from all
    </FilesMatch>
    “Options -Indexes” use to disable directory browsing
    “IndexIgnore *” use to prevent folder listing

In these case, “(?i)” part of the example is for caseless matching. And “(?<robots).txt” part is for ignori robots.txt file and protecting all the others.

If you want to ignore more file like robots.txt file. You can add like this “(?<robots|test|ignored|file).txt”. Now, users can access robots.txt, test.txt, ignored.txt, file.txt


htaccess, filesmatch, files, match, ignore
