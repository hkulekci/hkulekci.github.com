<p>Web sharing httpd is running when i restart my macbook and zend server apachectl can not run. It returns me error like following errors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(48)Address already in use: make_sock: could not bind to address [::]:80</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I searched to solve this problem and i found something. Execute following codes on terminal to remove default Web Sharing server from startup on Mac OSx. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After that restart your computer. Thats all.</p>
